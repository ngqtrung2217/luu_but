# Steps to Fix Music Database and Player Issues

## Database Setup
1. Run the SQL commands in `scripts/setup-supabase.sql` on your Supabase database
   - This will create the necessary tables and permissions
   - Make sure the music_meta table exists

2. Create a "songs" bucket in your Supabase storage with public read permissions
   - Go to Storage in the Supabase dashboard
   - Create a new bucket called "songs"
   - Set the RLS policy to allow anonymous reads

## Environment Variables
3. Verify your `.env.local` file has the correct Supabase credentials:
   ```
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_supabase_url
   NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key
   ```

## Fix MusicPlayer Component
4. Replace your current MusicPlayer.tsx with the fixed version in `temp/new-MusicPlayer.tsx`
   - This version has better error handling
   - Will show proper loading states and error messages

## Testing
5. Login to the admin panel and upload some MP3 files
6. Check the browser console for any error messages
7. If you still have issues, verify the Supabase URL in the logs matches your database URL

## Common Issues
- The music_meta table may not exist in your database
- Storage bucket permissions may not allow public reads
- CORS issues with accessing files from Supabase storage
- Network connectivity issues to your Supabase instance
